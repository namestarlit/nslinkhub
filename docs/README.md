# Documentation

The navigation map for repository knowledge. Start with the root
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md), then [PRODUCT.md](../PRODUCT.md) (the PRD),
[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md) (the system-architecture authority) and,
for web work, [DESIGN.md](../DESIGN.md) (the visual system). New contributors
walk the [onboarding guide](guides/developer-onboarding-walkthrough.md) first.

## Documentation spaces

| Space | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [design-docs/](design-docs/README.md) | Focused current designs: domain, web, platform and delivery |
| [engineering-decisions/](engineering-decisions/README.md) | Settled foundations and their rationale; binding until superseded |
| [exec-plans/](exec-plans/README.md) | Active ExecPlans, completed plans and the tech-debt tracker |
| [runbooks/](runbooks/) | Local development, verification, migrations, release, operations |
| [guides/](guides/) | The onboarding walkthrough, pinned to a reviewed commit |

## Top-level policies

- [CORE_BELIEFS.md](CORE_BELIEFS.md) — engineering principles.
- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — tenant isolation, authorization, tokens and the
  auth boundary.
- [RELIABILITY.md](RELIABILITY.md) — idempotency, concurrency, jobs and data.

## Reading status and history

Designs state what is implemented and label accepted work that is still planned.
`PRODUCT.md` §11 owns delivery order; code and shared contracts establish the
implemented API. An accepted decision can precede its implementation.

Current designs and runbooks describe behavior directly. Keep dates and before/
after accounts in `CHANGELOG.md`, completed plans and ADR rationale when they
explain a decision, migration or acceptance limit. Completed plans are historical
evidence, not current implementation instructions.

## Where things go

```text
idea or question -> PRODUCT.md §10 open decisions
  -> focused design in design-docs/, when needed
  -> engineering decision, when a durable foundation is settled
  -> active ExecPlan, when implementation is ready
  -> completed plan, CHANGELOG entry, docs updated
```

Renames and field changes are changelog material, not decisions. Disposable
context lives in the git-ignored `ref/`; the shared namestarlit workspace
mapping is in [PLANS.md](../PLANS.md#shared-namestarlit-workspace).
