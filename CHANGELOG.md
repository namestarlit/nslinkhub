# Changelog

All notable project changes are recorded here for humans and agents. Follow
the spirit of [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and use
Conventional Commit categories when preparing commits.

This file is not a replacement for design docs or ExecPlans. It is the durable
summary of what changed after completed work has been promoted out of `ref/`.

## Unreleased

- Designed people and hubs as separate identities (ADR-0018): a person has an
  @username and a name; their hub — the face that owns their collections and
  subscribers, with its own name and @handle — is optional and created on the
  first saved link or collection. Sign in creates the account only; "Save your
  first link" is sign in plus add the link. People subscribe to hubs. Hubs live
  at `/@handle` and people at `/username`, with the app's route words reserved.
- Scope settled: nslinkhub stays a personal product. One person has one hub
  (shown as "Hub Name, by @handle"), the hub is never transferred (only
  collections are), people follow people, and collaboration is per collection
  with **contributors** and **viewers** (renamed from editors and readers next).
  An email change is only an email change. Hubs as organizations with members
  were explored and rejected (ADR-0017); GitHub-style organizations remain a
  later option. The credit for shaping a collection is "contributors"; the
  platform console will move to `/platform`; items open by `?item=` links. A hub
  page reads "@handle", or "@handle by Owner Name" when the owner shows it.
- People appear everywhere by their @handle; a name shows only on the person's
  own hub page (if they choose), and the API no longer sends names anywhere
  else. Comments read TikTok-style: "@handle · Contributor", then the age
  leading the actions ("53m  Reply"). The collection header keeps the owner,
  contributors and update time on one line, with Add a link moved up into the
  top bar; on narrow screens History and Edit fold behind a button that expands
  them in place, and the phone share panel stays on screen.
- Activity and attribution: every content change — a collection created or
  its details changed; links, references and sections added; items edited,
  removed, reordered or imported; comments hidden, shown or answered — is an
  activity entry written with the change. Collections show their contributors
  ("Paul John and 2 contributors"), items record who added them, and
  contributors get a History page of who did what. The hub audit includes the
  same entries; existing collections got a backfilled creation entry.
- Link metadata foundation: every link's page title, description and site name
  (text only) is stored once per address in `link_metadata` and shared across
  collections. Saving writes a pending lookup in the same transaction; the
  worker resolves it within seconds, retrying at 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour
  and 6 hours (a failed address is retried when saved again, or when read a
  day later), and refreshes metadata older than 30 days when read. Lookups no
  longer run in the API process or change an item's version, and Save a link's
  preview reuses stored metadata. The resource field `titleOverride` is now
  `title`, with `description` and `siteName`; imports ignore source titles and
  cap addresses at 2,048 characters.
- `PRODUCT.md` reorganized as a PRD in pigfarm's flow: design context,
  overview, goals (guides north star; free library, paid Curator accounts),
  target users with their needs, proposed success measures, the hub and access
  model with roles, thirteen functional modules (purpose, status, behavior),
  technical requirements, acceptance, scope, open decisions, delivery and
  references. Journeys and requirements no longer repeat each other.
- Curator account direction gains **AI curation**: send everything in one
  bucket and get back a reviewable draft with proposed collections, sections,
  tags and notes, and duplicates, dead links and unsafe sites flagged; nothing
  lands without the person's review, and titles still come from the pages.
- Product direction: everyone's library stays free, and professional curators
  (educators, researchers, community and learning-program leaders) opt into a
  paid **Curator account** with analytics, members-only collections, bigger
  bulk work, link health and API access — also for people collecting resources
  from the open web at scale who use it as a curation layer, with rate limits
  sized to their plan (ADR-0016; details after the everyday build).
  Per collection, owners and editors are now **Contributors**: the discussion
  badge, hidden-comment notes and "Paul John and 2 contributors" attribution.
  The link annotation is simply the **note**.
- Closed open product decisions: sections are added and assigned in a
  collection's edit view; preview cards show the page description (the
  curator's note, up to 280 characters, in full in the details); notifications
  are in-app apart from codes, invitations, targeted shares and security; Word,
  Markdown and PDF downloads; account deletion with a 14-day grace period; bulk
  import limits confirmed; popular tags from published collections only. Manage
  gains Access (requests to view or edit, shares, link-shared collections);
  blocking happens where a person appears, with People listing followers and
  blocked accounts; follows belong to the hub and survive a handover.
- Designed three directions and added them to the build order: **Manage**, one
  workspace scoped by role, where every hub owner manages their hub
  (collections, comments, people and blocking, import, activity) and operators
  and admins keep the service sections (ADR-0014); **activity and
  attribution**, GitHub-style, where every change is recorded and drives the
  creator, curators, "added by" and the hub audit (ADR-0015); and **your
  home and following**: My collections, Shared with me, Saved and Following,
  with Follow on public hub pages. Everyone who shapes a collection is shown as a
  curator; Manage's Import & export section holds bulk import and multi-
  collection export, while a collection page offers Download; following
  notifies with a per-hub toggle; blocking stops participation only.
  Notifications are designed as one inbox for every kind (following,
  comments, saves and follows, sharing, invitations, imports, service), scoped
  by role, with settings on the Notifications page; they move up the build
  order ahead of following.
- Backlog brought up to date: seven finished plans closed; `PRODUCT.md` §9 now
  lists everything still to build, in order (link metadata, bulk import,
  preview cards with curator's notes and Add to my collection, collection
  management in the web, discussion follow-ups, Discover search, the rest of
  the internals pass, account work, the extension, direct shares to people
  without an account, ns-series single sign-on, release). Item-level saves are
  replaced by Add to my collection (a quick save); following hubs is planned.
  Preview cards are metadata only (no images or icons, so viewing never
  contacts linked sites) with just View and Edit; targeted sharing is by
  invitation, which needs an account. Monetization is chosen after the build.
- Discussion replies from a collection's owner or editors are all badged
  Curator. Permission roles stay `reader`/`editor`; labels are chosen per
  surface (ADR-0013). Bulk import is designed as Save a link at scale — a
  reviewed draft with resolved titles, in-place fixes and folders mapped to
  sections or separate collections (ADR-0012, `docs/design-docs/bulk-import.md`).
- Documentation reorganized the pigfarm way: `PRODUCT.md` is the PRD (now with
  a product design context), `ARCHITECTURE.md` the system-architecture
  authority (domain model, client surfaces and invariants absorbed), and the
  new root `DESIGN.md` the visual system with every theme token (replacing
  `docs/design-docs/web-design-tokens.md`). `docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` was split
  into focused designs — tenancy and access, identity and handles, collections
  and resources, discussion, email verification, exports — with its delivery
  status moved to `PRODUCT.md` §9. New `docs/README.md` map; the design-docs
  index is now `README.md`.
- Product and system docs brought up to date: `PRODUCT.md` is now a shareable
  product definition (problem and goals, users, journeys, requirements,
  acceptance, current state by surface, open decisions such as the editor role
  name and titles on import). `docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` describes the
  verification flow, link titles and public addresses, the operations console,
  the squashed migration and the current delivery status. `PLANS.md` maps the
  repository's plans to the shared namestarlit workspace, which now lists
  nslinkhub as its active product.
- Engineering decision records (`docs/engineering-decisions/`) for the
  foundations much else depends on — tenancy, identities, backend-owned rules,
  passwordless codes, serialized writes, pre-deployment changes, resolved
  titles, references, operator authority, the verification flow, toolchain —
  each with its rationale and constraints. A change that contradicts one must
  supersede it explicitly.
- One email-verification flow for every situation (sign in, first link,
  signing in to do something, a session that ended mid-action, confirming a
  sensitive action, invitations): the same two screens, worded for the
  purpose ("Sign in to join the discussion.", "Your session ended before we
  could post your comment."). Actions interrupted by an ended session now
  continue after signing in instead of being lost, and only for the person
  they belong to. Toasts use the page's own
  surface and border instead of an inverted pill; a resent code says so, a
  first send doesn't repeat what the page already says.
- Sensitive operator actions that need a fresh code now ask "Confirm it's you"
  (names the action and the signed-in email; Send code or Cancel, nothing is
  emailed until chosen), then finish the action by itself once the code is
  accepted. Code screens say "Didn't receive the code? Send a new code" and
  accept codes pasted with spaces or dashes. Ops tabs no longer scroll.
- Service operations redesigned around four accessible tabs (Accounts,
  Collections, Team, Audit). Accounts: search by email or hub handle, a table
  with suspend/reactivate and sign-out quick actions. Collections: review from a
  pasted collection link; held collections listed and released from their row.
  Team: invite field plus operator and invitation tables with Resend and Revoke.
  Audit: one filter row (search, action, dates, Clear filters) over a table with
  hub handles. Confirmation checkboxes removed; search text never appears in
  page URLs. API: `accounts?q=`, `collections` (held), `collections/resolve`,
  audit `q`; `POST accounts/lookup` and audit `actor`/`target` removed.
- "Add a link" sits in a collection's fixed header, under its metadata, so it is
  always in reach without scrolling.
- Links must be public web addresses: localhost, loopback, IP, local/internal
  and example/test names (`example.com`, `.test`, …) are refused by the API
  (`link_not_public`, imports report `not_public_url`) and flagged in red in
  Save a link.
- Pre-deployment reset: all migrations squashed into one `0_init` (schema
  unchanged, verified with `migrate diff`); the unused `users.bio`,
  `capture_receipts.hub_id` and `resource_id` columns are gone. New
  `bun run db:seed` loads six real collections curated from the engineering
  toolkit, with sections and titles read from the pages.
- Cleanup: removed the dead inline-rename path, the `/profile` and
  `/invitations` redirect pages, unused props, notices and styles; shared
  limits (2 links per save, 30 tags of 80 characters) and input checks now live
  in one place for the API and the web.
- Save a link takes one or two links per save, each with optional tags
  (added as chips behind "Add tags"; the collection edit page uses the same
  shared tag field), into one chosen collection. The link
  field turns blue when the page's title is found and red, blocking the save,
  for a repeat, a non-address or a domain that doesn't exist; a "Bulk import
  links" button tells people who press it that import is coming.
  Titles are never typed: they are resolved from the page (shown as you
  paste; YouTube via oEmbed), and links still missing a title are resolved
  when their collection is opened.
  New collections are named on creation (suggested "Saved links, Oct 7", never
  repeating), and the destination list shows when each was last updated.
  `POST /api/v1/capture` now takes `links[]` and returns `resourceIds`; new
  `GET /api/v1/link-preview`. Titles are no longer accepted when adding links
  or references, and item edits change only tags and position: what belongs to
  a link (address, title) or a heading stays as saved.
- Focus rings show only for keyboard navigation: after a mouse or touch press
  no outline appears (including when returning from another window); Tab or
  arrow keys bring it back.
- Review fixes: a reference to a collection the reader cannot open no longer
  reveals its id or stored title; exports render outside the global write lock;
  default hub names keep every word of a name (only generated handles drop
  their random suffix, and retry suffixes never reach the name).
- Hub and collection sharing use the same unboxed section and text actions.
  Hubs show it inline below the description; collections keep it above Discussion.
  Copy confirmations reserve space so nearby content stays still.

- Discussion disclosures retain pointer focus without gaining a blue outline
  after window switching; keyboard navigation still shows the focus indicator.

- The desktop collection share panel and Discussion header stay visible while
  comments scroll independently. Add a comment opens the composer, whose hint
  invites questions or notes. Closing preserves drafts; sign-in returns readers
  to the open composer. Native disclosures work without JavaScript.

- Sharing is one row of text links (LinkedIn, X, WhatsApp, Share link) with a
  “Link copied to clipboard.” confirmation beneath; Reply/Edit in comments put
  the cursor in the text box.
- Collection reading smoothly folds the description before links begin scrolling,
  retaining the title, tags and author/update metadata. Continued scroll input
  carries through the transition; returning to the top restores the description.
  Reduced-motion preferences skip animation.

- Review repairs: partial imports isolate database row failures with savepoints;
  bounded multipart parsing finishes before the authority lock and session
  recheck. Sign-in resend cooldowns no longer invalidate flow cookies. Replies
  paginate per thread with accepted answers first and native continuation links.
  Page-title lookups use one aborting deadline across DNS, redirects and streaming
  bodies. Signed web DELETE forms retain each visitor's source budget.

- Emails end with the web footer (support prompt, “© year nslinkhub”, “an ns
  series product”); code emails keep a single “Do not share this code with
  anyone.” warning. The footer always links the new web `/support` page, which
  shows the support address from `SUPPORT_EMAIL`; the site footer links Discover
  and Support.
- People appear the same way everywhere: name (only if they show it) plus
  `@handle`, linking to their hub. Collection pages show “Created by” when the
  creator differs from the owner. The discovery API is now `GET /api/v1/discover`.
- Collections have a discussion: signed-in readers with access comment and
  reply (one level), curator replies are labelled, owners/editors mark the answer
  and hide comments, authors edit or delete their own, and owners can switch
  comments off on the edit page (new `collection_comments` table and
  `collections.comments_enabled`). Notifications and operator moderation for
  comments are the next milestone.
- The web app has one cohesive visual system: self-hosted Schibsted Grotesk on
  every OS, one left content edge, ink titles with accent reserved for actions,
  one control size (38 px, 44 px on touch), and a refreshed light/dark palette
  with recalculated contrast. The wordmark stays the plain `nslinkhub` text.
- Discover (`/discover`, formerly Explore) leads with “Someone already found your
  next good read.” over calm, fully clickable collection cards. Collections read
  as one sheet matching the landing example; resource rows open on a click
  anywhere. Owners get one Edit button and a dedicated `/c/:id/edit` page in place
  of per-field inline editing, plus an “Add a link” row; signed-in users get Save
  a link in the top bar.
- Share menus (Copy link, device share sheet, Email, X, LinkedIn, WhatsApp)
  replace Copy link on collections and hubs. Transient confirmations appear as
  top toasts; inline notices are info, warning or error toned. Landing questions
  loop with no control. Settings fits one view and drops the duplicate Sign out.
- The collection header stays fixed on desktop while sections and links scroll,
  with GitHub-style “Updated 3 hours ago” metadata; from 1024 px sharing sits in
  a permanent panel beside the collection.
- Pages feel faster: the layout reads session, profile and theme in parallel,
  navigations only show the loading state after ~300 ms, and returning to a tab
  re-checks the session instead of reloading the page.
- Sign-in codes can be resent once every 30 seconds per address (server enforced,
  with a live countdown on the code page).
- Saved links without a title get the page's title automatically after saving,
  through an SSRF-guarded fetch (public addresses only, pinned connection).
- Notifications are expandable items with unread markers; opening Notifications
  resets the badge and “Clear all” empties the list (new `notifications_seen_at`
  and `notifications_cleared_at` user columns; `/api/v1/notifications`).

- Unavailable collections explain that they may be private or no longer exist.
  Signed-out readers can sign in and return to the same collection; API reads
  keep private and missing targets indistinguishable.

- **Breaking:** collections are independent. Removed parent fields, nesting/children
  endpoints, inherited grants/holds and recursive ownership operations. Collection
  references are ordinary ordered resources, including references across hubs;
  each destination keeps its own permissions. Deleting a target leaves an
  unavailable reference, while source deletion/transfer never affects targets.
- Guides support ordered heading resources. Markdown, PDF and Word exports keep
  references as links by default; explicit expansion includes one readable level,
  preserves headings and marks unavailable references without leaking content.
  Web reference navigation uses immutable URLs without forwarding share tokens.

- Profile settings adds an autosaving “Show my name on my hub” switch. Turning it
  off hides owner attribution on hubs and public collection metadata without
  changing the saved full name or hub identity. Existing accounts default to on.

- Your hub now shows its name, handle, optional owner name and description
  above Your collections, with Copy hub link beneath the description.
  Save a link remains the main creation action. Public preview stays in Settings.
- Collection owners edit the title, description and tags in place, saving on
  blur/Enter with cancellation, retained failed drafts and version-conflict recovery.
  Native forms remain available without JavaScript.
- Stable `/h/:hubId` and readable `/@handle` routes show owners their own hub
  and visitors published content. `/hub` redirects to the stable address; Settings
  explicitly opens the public preview with `?view=public`.

- Settings renders Profile and Hub directly, without Account/Appearance tabs.
  Appearance stays in the header. Profile includes
  email and member-since; Sign out sits at the bottom. Copy hub link shares the
  permanent address with an outlined button before View your public hub.
  Full name belongs to the user; the hub has an independent Hub name, public
  Description, immutable ID and editable handle. The user bio editor is removed. Changes autosave with draft recovery and a retained public-hub link.
- Public hubs resolve by stable `/h/:hubId` or readable `/@handle`, and show
  “@handle by <owner name>” when named, otherwise only the handle. Their grouped
  header places the Copy hub link text action below the description. The collection
  count sits with its heading, and empty feedback stays beneath it. Hub creation and update
  dates are omitted; collection update dates remain. Counts exclude private and held content across all pages. Collection
  previews show description, tags, hub handle, owner attribution and updated date.
- Account avatars prefer a chosen image, then Gravatar for the verified email,
  then the generated fallback. Gravatar is proxied; email hashes stay server-side.
- Header Explore and Sign in links match the weight of text actions.
- The header uses one icon button cycling System → Light → Dark → System, with
  System as the default and the current mode shown by its icon.
- Hid unnecessary single-page collection pagination and exposed collection name,
  description and tags in one edit form, including native form error recovery.

- New accounts without a usable name receive readable generated hub handles
  instead of `hub`/`hub-2`. Defaults do not expose email addresses; supplied names
  still seed handles, and existing handles remain unchanged.

- Added first-link capture through verified email, atomic private collection/link
  creation, concurrent-first-save handling and scoped replay receipts. Added
  owned-collection hub navigation, add-another and optional rename with retry drafts.
- Refined collection browsing with description previews, hub/date metadata,
  whitespace grouping and desktop pages sized to the available frame; mobile
  retains scrolling. Kept Sign in navigation and purposeful structural dividers.

### Public landing and neutral theme

- Kept button-styled links free of text underlines on hover, consistent with
  native buttons.

- Paired saving and discovery in one desktop composition beside a compact
  collection example. Kept the discovery CTA directly beneath its heading,
  moved browsing guidance to Explore, and preserved mobile stacking.

- Introduced a non-looping typed question sequence on the landing page, with
  four-second reading pauses, Pause/Resume/Replay controls, stable layout and
  static reduced-motion/no-JavaScript alternatives.

- Kept header/footer visible around a scrollable content area, with an accessible
  document-scroll fallback for very short viewports. Explore and public hubs use
  compact responsive collection lists. Removed decorative arrows from links.

- Added a product landing page at `/` and moved public collection browsing to
  `/explore`, preserving pagination and reader recovery links.
- Grouped Explore with the account controls on the right of the header, leaving
  the wordmark on the left. Signed-in wordmarks still open the user's own hub.
- Refined light/dark surfaces with neutral grays and charcoal, preserving the
  blue accent, accessible feedback colors and system appearance default.


### Generated avatars

- Added deterministic SVG avatars from immutable user UUIDs to the account menu
  and profile. The API preserves the approved shape/color algorithm, validates
  seeds and dimensions, and supports immutable caching and conditional ETags.
- Added a UUID avatar redirect without account lookup; no external image
  provider, persistence or uploaded-photo support is introduced.

### Profile feedback and navigation loading

- Kept one explicit Save profile action, enhanced to save in place with green
  inline “Saved” feedback beside the button, retained drafts on failure and protection for newer edits.
- Added authenticated live hub-handle validation; final writes still enforce
  uniqueness, including competing claims. The hint previews the public address
  and shows validation guidance only when the handle changes.
- Replaced full-page navigation skeletons with compact progress and delayed
  reload recovery, preserving private-content revalidation.

- Added page-specific browser titles with the nslinkhub suffix.

### Account navigation and appearance

- Added an avatar-only account menu with Profile, Notifications, Settings, authorized Service
  operations and Sign out. The wordmark keeps its normal color without an
  underline and sends signed-in users to their own hub. Explore is always in
  the header, replacing the duplicate hub/collection breadcrumbs.
- Added Light, Dark and System themes with a browser preference that persists
  without JavaScript. Appearance lives in Settings; signed-out visitors always
  follow their device theme. The footer stacks the current-year product copyright
  above a smaller “an ns series product” line.
- Removed the client Service status page and links; API health and readiness
  endpoints remain available for monitoring.
- Connected profile editing to the existing own-account name, biography and hub
  handle API; credentials remain outside the profile form.
- Added Notifications for service invitations, with a badge for invitations needing
  attention. These are informational messages directing recipients to email,
  without an extra invitation-page chain. Sharing updates follow
  in the next notification milestone.

### Local development

- Routed the root dev launcher through API, worker and web workspace scripts,
  with named startup/failure output and an explicit web ready URL. Extended
  dev-loop acceptance to check the sign-in page and readiness announcement.

### Service operations

- Added startup admin invitations and admin-only operator invitation management.
  Acceptance starts from a private emailed link. Inviting/previewing creates no
  account; new recipients enter their name and accept, then verify an emailed OTP.
  Every recipient verifies a fresh invitation-bound email OTP before the role
  activates, including signed-in users; existing names remain unchanged. Email
  invitations now have a prominent **Review invitation** button.
  Tokens rotate on resend; account invitation lists are status-only. Added expiry, resend/cancel, access revocation,
  invitation audit and zero-admin invitation recovery; removed direct operator CLI
  grants. Replays and restarts never restore revoked access.
- Root workspace commands and development launcher use exact Bun `--filter`
  selectors; Prisma retains its configuration directory.

- Added native email-code sign-in, resend/recovery, sign-out and `/ops` account,
  collection-moderation and audit pages, including operation without JavaScript.
- Added accepted admin/operator grants, account suspension/recovery,
  session revocation and public collection distribution holds. Restrictions cover
  authentication, lists, section/resource reads, exports and redistribution,
  while preserving active-owner correction and private-content boundaries.
- Added atomic operator audit, expected versions and idempotent commands, recent
  verification, serialized authority checks, bounded retention and an invitation/recovery
  runbook. No real operator is automatically seeded.
- Preserved visitor request budgets for native forms using separate signed source
  attribution; browser Origin validation remains mandatory. Document referrers
  disclose only the origin so native POST retains Origin without leaking paths.

### Web reading

- Added `/status` and public navigation with aggregate ready/limited/unavailable
  states, separate unconfirmed failures, deliberate rechecks, Retry-After and
  no-JavaScript recovery. The page omits dependency details and remote error
  messages; status links and API reads never propagate share tokens.
- Added production browser status acceptance for real readiness responses,
  outages, failure recovery, responsive keyboard access and cancelled rechecks.
  Global loading feedback now covers both collection and status navigation.

- Added public hub browsing at `/@handle` and pretty collection reading at
  `/@handle/<slug>`, reusing the permalink reader and copying only immutable
  `/c/<id>` links unless shared access is explicitly requested. Public lists
  stay publication-only for owners and other visitors; readers link back to
  the public owning hub without forwarding share tokens.
- Added hub-aware cursor continuation, current-route recovery, duplicate
  suppression and accurate append announcements. Production browser coverage
  proves no-JavaScript navigation, privacy, rename durability, failure/retry,
  revocation and responsive keyboard reading; encoded `@` route parameters
  have a source regression.

- Added explicit reload recovery when document navigation is cancelled, keeping
  stale reader content hidden until fresh server authorization. Browser coverage
  checks Escape cancellation, keyboard recovery and revocation while waiting.

- Prevented API-local env files from overriding disposable verification
  databases or restoring live delivery/telemetry settings. API, browser and
  dev-loop runners now preserve explicit masks through nested child processes;
  regression fixtures cover conflicting env files and configuration resolution.

- Preserved per-visitor API read budgets through authenticated server source
  attribution, restored saved section title overrides/tags, and made the dev
  orchestrator honor API-local port configuration before checking listeners
  and configuring the web API origin. Added spoofing, budget-isolation, metadata
  and environment-precedence regressions.

- Added the first W3 vertical slice: explore → collection permalink → section
  or external resource, with cursor continuation, no-JavaScript fallback,
  safe errors, explicit shared-link copying and responsive keyboard reading.
- Adopted Pigfarm's separate runtime config, HTTP-client and host dev-loop
  patterns under NSLinkHub's same-origin, uncached-data contracts. Web code
  consumes API wire types; import checks reject persistence/backend access.
- Added browser-origin protection for cookie-authenticated API mutations and
  production browser verification using isolated API/database fixtures. Image
  builds remain separate deployment work.

### Development and release workflow

- Fixed intermittent auth-delivery test failures by extracting the standalone
  email code rather than an eight-digit segment in a generated target address.
  The handover fixture now exercises that numeric-address case deterministically;
  production authentication behavior is unchanged.

- Separated routine application verification from Docker image acceptance.
  Push/PR CI keeps compilation and real-service tests; the manual release
  workflow now gates image publication on the image build and rehearsal.
- Closed the reviewed local auth-delivery milestone and made W3 scaffolding
  next. Fresh image acceptance remains tracked for deployment preparation.

### Auth delivery

- Removed better-auth's additional production-only HTTP throttle so code
  issuance and resends follow the documented shared PostgreSQL budgets. Added
  production-process HTTP coverage proving both identity and source limits
  still apply; per-proof wrong-attempt protection remains enabled.

- Fixed cross-workflow email-change proof collisions by namespacing library
  verification and outbox identifiers with an unambiguous account/session/address
  tuple. Restarting handover invalidates both prior proofs and pending mail;
  legacy unscoped proofs cannot authorize a handover. Added collision, restart,
  attempt-limit and legacy-proof regressions.

- Preserved recipient suppression across auth-secret rotation with an independent
  stable suppression secret. Signed Resend delivery references reconcile lost
  receipts and bounce/complaint suppression even after expired codes are erased.

- Added codes-only sign-in and two-step account-email change through better-auth,
  with keyed proof storage, shared abuse budgets, purpose/session/target binding,
  transactional hub onboarding and all-session revocation after handover.
- Added encrypted PostgreSQL email intent, an isolated BullMQ relay/worker,
  capture and Resend providers, retries/claims, signed idempotent webhooks,
  suppression and credential/metadata cleanup. Production topology uses the
  same immutable image for a separate worker; no live delivery is claimed.
- Removed direct authentication links from email templates and product contracts;
  removed password signup, sign-in, enrollment, change and reset by explicit
  pre-deployment product decision. Optional TOTP/recovery codes are a separate milestone.
- Removed profile credential writes and disabled account deletion pending its
  verified retention workflow. Email handover revokes all sessions, with no password route back in.

### Documentation

- Defined the service-operator milestone: account lookup, suspension/reactivation,
  session revocation, public-content holds and audit. Documented deployment-only
  grants, privacy boundaries, recovery, concurrency and retention; reconciled
  the earlier no-admin wording to preserve the ban on private-content bypass.
  Implemented the reusable web sign-in journey and operator workflows below.

- Recorded the reviewed W3 reading milestone and the next planned vertical
  journey: public hub → pretty collection URL → section/resource. Added API
  evidence, privacy and rename acceptance, and corrected stale web-scaffold
  and Phase E routing status. The subsequent implementation is recorded above.

- Reconciled auth-delivery status across system design, onboarding, reliability
  and adoption guidance. Documented the additive migration chain, current email
  queue and audit retention, and separated local backend completion from
  outstanding browser and live-provider acceptance.

- Recorded a pinned comparison with Pigfarm (`f0bab0a`) and the remaining
  foundation adoption decisions in `docs/design-docs/adoption-decisions.md`.
  The sequence separates W3 design, test isolation and safe wire/error contracts
  before web implementation, auth/email delivery with the code-first account
  journey, and public-release operational gates. Reference-only proposals and
  incomplete deployment work are distinguished from implemented patterns.
- Updated the observability direction to LogTape + Sentry application
  telemetry with shared Alloy collecting stdout and dependency metrics;
  the comparison was documentation-only; implementation follows below.
  Retained NSLinkHub's individual
  hubs, stable URL scheme, and synchronous exports rather than adopting
  Pigfarm-specific product behavior.
- Reconciled the security document's stale membership rules with the built
  Drive model, recorded cookie-mutation/CSRF and auth-origin verification gates,
  expanded delivery failure/retention acceptance, and refreshed the debt tracker
  and onboarding walkthrough. The walkthrough pin must be advanced in its
  guide-only follow-up after the reviewed documentation commit exists.

### Added

- Pinned better-auth delivery spike with synthetic capture, recording OTP
  replay/expiry/resend behavior and native code/link, email-change/session and
  delivery-callback incompatibilities, subsequently addressed by the codes-only
  transaction-scoped integration above.
- Explicit auth composition factory for persistence, configuration and
  delivery plugins. Profile writes no longer accept email/password; password
  authentication is disabled. Account
  deletion is disabled pending verified proof and retention. Test processes
  force capture delivery regardless of local Resend settings.

- W3 design milestone for adoption gate #2: product experience, interface
  system and canonical Tailwind token documents, including verified palette
  contrast, read-only journeys, browser boundary requirements, recency-first
  discovery and dormant-save presentation. Web implementation remains next.

- Completed local adoption gate #1: shared typed error catalog, trusted
  application exceptions, status-safe framework mapping and bounded DTO
  field/rule issues. Validation details now use `issues` instead of `messages`;
  actionable domain conflicts have stable codes rather than generic messages.
- Explicit ISO-string mappers checked against shared wire types, plus real
  HTTP contracts for W3 reads, sharing privacy, dormant saves, audit, readiness,
  malformed input and hidden/missing 404 equivalence.
- Local Markdown-link/anchor enforcement and concurrent disposable-database
  lifecycle checks in the full verification gate. Cleanup now waits for DB
  creation and child shutdown before dropping only its owned database.
  Preservation checks use an owned sentinel so unrelated runs cleaning up
  their databases cannot cause false failures.

- Local release foundations (#4 first): telemetry-first API startup, pinned
  LogTape/Sentry logging, isolated request traces/metrics, SDK privacy hooks,
  sanitized unexpected failures and bounded shutdown. Real local SDK-envelope
  tests cover privacy, concurrency, correlation, aborts and collector failure.
- Transactional publication/share/link/transfer/deletion/handle audit with
  owner-scoped `GET /api/v1/me/audit`, including audit-read records and retained
  source-hub history after transfer. Added shared PostgreSQL request budgets,
  explicit proxy trust, safe fail-closed responses and bounded counter cleanup.
- API Dockerfile, local/production Swarm definitions, verification and manual
  GHCR-image workflows, plus a disposable image/migration/backup-restore/outage
  rehearsal and operator release runbook. Live infrastructure is deferred;
  artifacts do not claim Swarm, Dokploy, off-host restore or Alloy readiness.
- Pulled isolated e2e databases and explicit source test discovery forward from
  #1; tests no longer write to/reset development data or consume its request
  budgets. Added a telemetry import/logging boundary check to verification.

### Fixed

- Release-image rehearsal now mounts synthetic secret files individually,
  preserving the private host directory while allowing a different container
  UID to read them. Fixes the first hosted CI run's migration-step EACCES;
  added a UID-65534 read check to prevent recurrence.

- Production startup now executes the actual compiled `dist/src/entrypoint.js`
  with compiled alias resolution; builds explicitly generate Prisma from schema.
  Link enable reads token state under its transaction lock so a stale request
  cannot restore a rotated token. Fresh TypeScript 6 installs use explicit
  email-package ambient types and NodeNext-compatible shared type exports.

### Added

- Stack-wide local conventions adopted (zanlis.dwh handoff): nslinkhub owns
  the **+4 local port offset** — compose publishes PostgreSQL at
  `127.0.0.1:5436` and Redis at `127.0.0.1:6383` (in-code dev defaults
  updated to match; API stays at its project-specific 4000) per
  `/home/ns/Person/stack/docs/local-port-registry.md`; topology files are
  named `docker-stack.<env>.yml` (hyphen — docs updated ahead of the first
  stack file). Along the way: `prisma.config.ts` now resolves
  `DATABASE_URL` through `readSecret` with the local default, so
  `bunx prisma migrate deploy` is zero-config on a fresh clone (a stale
  local `.env` had been masking that it previously required the variable),
  and README's remaining pre-reshape claims (username plugin/routes, queued
  PDF note) are gone.

- Verified pushes, enforced locally (pigfarm pre-push handoff): a versioned
  `tooling/git-hooks/pre-push` hook runs `bun run verify` before every push;
  `bun install` wires it via the root `prepare` script
  (`tooling/setup-git-hooks.ts` sets `core.hooksPath`, no-op without
  `.git`). Deletion-only pushes skip; emergencies bypass with
  `git push --no-verify` or `SKIP_VERIFY=1` (generic name — branding stays
  out of env vars). The fast-hook/CI-authoritative escalation path is
  documented in the verification runbook ahead of its trigger.

- Developer onboarding walkthrough (`docs/guides/`, the first guide-track
  doc): six follow-along sessions — make it run, product model, curl
  walkthrough, failure drills + policy trace, config/verification, W3
  direction + readiness gate — replacing the read-everything-then-act ref/
  guide (pigfarm walkthrough-format handoff). The guide pins the commit it
  was last verified against, and `check:guide-pin` (in `bun run verify`)
  fails when any file the guide links changes after the pin; clearing it is
  a sweep + pin bump in a guide-only commit. `docs/exec-plans/` and
  `CHANGELOG.md` are exempt (the guide points at them by design). README's
  stale "Implemented So Far" (pre-reshape vocabulary) rewritten while adding
  the front-door links.

- `docs/SECURITY.md` § "Origins, CORS, and CSRF": records that the absence of
  CORS configuration is deliberate and complete (CORS relaxes the browser's
  Same-Origin Policy; configuring nothing grants no relaxation), why CORS can
  never be the access-control boundary, the CSRF nuance (simple-shaped
  requests still send; JSON bodies force failing preflights; better-auth owns
  origin checks on auth routes), and the standing rule: any future
  state-changing endpoint accepting a "simple" browser request shape adds
  explicit CSRF protection at that moment. Written so future security reviews
  don't misread the absence as an oversight. Also de-staled the membership-era
  wording in the auth-boundary and audit sections.

- Root scripts adopt the `<service>:<action>` convention: `infra:up` /
  `infra:down` (docker compose), `api:dev` / `api:start` / `api:prod` /
  `api:build` / `api:test`, `email:test`, `types:typecheck`. Per-service dev
  scripts chain `infra:up` (idempotent), so there is no start-order to
  remember; bare `dev` is the daily orchestrator (infra + API watch; the web
  joins it at W3). The old `start:*`/`test`/`typecheck:*` root names are gone
  (one way per action).

- Account-email change is specified as the double-verified handover flow
  (Substack model): confirm from the current address (which sees the target
  address; ignoring changes nothing) → verify the new address → change
  applies and all sessions are revoked. Sign-in direction decided:
  **code-first from the get-go** (continue with email → code screen; the
  email carries code + direct link; password is the explicit alternative,
  never the headline — no username era to migrate away from). The W3
  Impeccable pass shapes presentation, not flow order. Both documented in
  SYSTEM_DESIGN/PRODUCT; templates for the two change steps
  (`renderEmailChangeConfirmation`, `renderNewEmailVerification`) join
  `packages/email` on a shared code-email base. Wiring lands with the
  auth-delivery slice.
- `packages/email` (`@nslinkhub/email`): backend-owned React Email templates,
  starting with the **sign-in code** email (`renderLoginCode`) — Substack-style
  minimal layout with the lowercase `nslinkhub` wordmark, large spaced code,
  validity line, sign-in button + plain-link fallback, bold do-not-share
  warning, muted support footer. Typed and validated inputs (https-only URLs,
  code format, 1–60 min expiry), HTML + plain-text renders, subject never
  carries the code. Wired into `bun run verify` (typecheck + tests). Delivery
  (Resend adapter, outbox, worker) still lands with the auth-delivery slice
  per `docs/design-docs/transactional-email.md`.

- Nested access inheritance: the collection access policy now resolves up the
  ancestor chain, so a share, active link, or publication on a parent
  collection grants the same access to its descendants (and their resources),
  Drive-folder style. Also fixes published nested guides — a published
  table-of-contents collection now makes its sub-sections readable. A link
  grant records against the collection whose link was actually used (which may
  be an ancestor).

- Collection ownership transfer (`POST /api/v1/collections/:id/transfer`,
  `{ email }`). Drive-style: only the owner may transfer, only to a user who is
  already an `editor`. The collection subtree moves into the recipient's hub,
  the recipient's now-redundant shares are removed, the previous owner is given
  `editor` access across the subtree (landing it in their shared/), and the
  immutable creator is untouched. Guards: self-transfer and recipient-hub slug
  collisions are rejected.

### Changed

- Updated the workspace TypeScript compiler from 5.9.3 to 6.0.3 across the
  API, shared types, and email packages.

### Fixed

- Sign-up no longer auto-issues a reserved hub handle (review finding #2). The
  handle rules moved to a shared `hubs/handle.ts` used by both `HubsService`
  and the framework-free onboarding path; `createPersonalHub` skips reserved
  handles when deriving one (e.g. a user named "Explore" gets `explore-2`, not
  the reserved `explore`).

### Added (W3 readiness)

- `GET /api/v1/hubs/by-handle/:handle` — handle → hub-page resolution, backing
  the web's `/@handle` URLs (the payload carries the immutable `hubId`).
- `GET /api/v1/collections/:id` — the durable permalink read: the immutable id
  survives slug renames (hub+slug stays the pretty URL). Same optional-auth +
  share-token + ETag semantics as the hub+slug lookup.
- `@nslinkhub/types` gained `users.ts` (`Profile`, `UpdateProfileRequest`) and
  `CollectionShareView.email` — present for direct shares (the owner supplied
  the email), `null` for link-source shares (their email was never the
  owner's to see).

- System status/readiness (pigfarm pattern): `GET /api/v1/status` now reports
  per-dependency readiness — postgres (authoritative; down = 503
  `dependencies_unavailable`) and the queue Redis (reserved for future email
  delivery; down = `degraded`, product fully usable). Checks use a fresh,
  non-reconnecting client with a 1.5s timeout; the API holds no standing Redis
  connection until the email worker wires BullMQ. `GET /api/v1/health` stays
  the dependency-free liveness probe. Redis config collapsed to one
  `REDIS_URL` (validated, `_FILE`-capable, local default
  `redis://127.0.0.1:6379`) — `REDIS_HOST`/`REDIS_PORT`/`REDIS_PASSWORD` are
  gone; the stale "nslinkhub-api-v2" service tag is gone with the old static
  status payload.
- Zero-config dev / required prod: development needs no configuration
  (in-code localhost defaults, no secret files), while anything provided is
  honored — resolution order is exported env var → optional `apps/api/.env`
  → in-code default. `_FILE` inputs are the deployed contract
  (previews/staging/production). With
  `NODE_ENV=production`, startup validation refuses to boot when
  `DATABASE_URL`/`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` are absent or the auth secret is the
  public dev default (unit-tested).
- Deployment-secret `_FILE` contract implemented
  (`apps/api/src/config/secret.ts` + unit tests): `DATABASE_URL_FILE` and
  `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET_FILE` (docker/swarm secrets) take precedence over the
  plain env vars; file content is trimmed; an unreadable `_FILE` path fails at
  startup; local defaults keep dev zero-config. Redis credentials adopt the
  same `readSecret` when the email worker wires BullMQ.

### Changed (W3 readiness)

- One public origin, no CORS: web and API are served same-origin (Traefik
  path-routes `/api/*` in production; Next.js rewrites proxy in dev). The API
  dev port moved to **4000** — 3000 belongs to the web app — and
  `BETTER_AUTH_URL` defaults to `http://localhost:4000`
  (see `docs/design-docs/infra-deployment.md` § Origins).
- `GET /collections/:id/children` is unpaginated and returns the plain section
  list: access inheritance guarantees every child of a readable parent is
  readable, so the per-child policy loop and the page/limit dialect (the API's
  only one) are gone; `PageMeta` left `@nslinkhub/types`. Section order lives
  in the parent's resources.
- Documented the web URL scheme as a W3 contract (`docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`):
  `/c/<id>` is the durable permalink (survives rename/transfer/re-nest; what
  share buttons emit), `/@handle` + `/@handle/<slug>` are flat pretty browse
  URLs allowed to break; no nested URL forms — structure never encodes into
  an address.
- Docs re-arranged: the authoritative design moved up to **`docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`**
  (was `docs/design-docs/hub-architecture.md` — the name had drifted; the doc
  covers the whole system, and the deep design now sits at a glance beside
  `SECURITY.md`/`RELIABILITY.md`). Root `ARCHITECTURE.md` stays the short
  stable map; `docs/design-docs/` holds only focused satellite designs. All
  references updated repo-wide.
- Docs de-staled after the Drive reshape: `transactional-email.md` no longer
  plans a "hub invitation" email (collection-share notification instead, and
  the outbox note reflects synchronous exports), `identity-sso.md` and
  `observability.md` dropped hub-role/invitation phrasing,
  `infra-deployment.md` worker example is the future email worker, Swagger
  metadata documents cookie + bearer auth (no more "Sprint 1").

### Changed

- Exports are synchronous and complete: `POST /api/v1/exports`
  `{ format, collectionIds[] (1–20), expand? }` replaces the queued-job design
  (`POST /collections/:id/export/markdown`, `/export/pdf`, and job polling are
  gone). All three formats ship — Markdown, PDF (`pdfkit`), and Word (`docx`)
  — via programmatic renderers, so no format needs a queue. Every collection
  id is authorization-checked up front; the response body is the file itself
  (`Content-Disposition: attachment`), zipped when several collections are
  selected (one document per collection). Documents read like a Google Doc:
  root collection = H1 + description, sub-collections expand in order as H2
  sections (never H3, by the two-level cap); `expand: false` collapses them to
  a single line. Removed the `ExportJob` model, `export_jobs` table, BullMQ
  processor, and export artifact/retention concerns; BullMQ/Redis stay in the
  stack solely for future email/notification delivery.
- Imports narrowed to bookmarks-HTML (primary migration path) plus a universal
  CSV column format (fill `url` + optional `title` from any tool); the
  WhatsApp-TXT parser is removed as too source-specific. Per-row error reports
  flag outlier rows to fix or drop. Import dedup now checks the resource's own
  canonical `url` (the `urlHash` lookup died with the links table).
- `@nslinkhub/types` caught up with the Drive model: removed the stale
  `ExportJob`/`ExportStatus`/`MarkdownExport` and membership-era types
  (`HubRole`, `MembershipStatus`, `InvitationStatus`, `HubMember`,
  `HubInvitation`, invitation/role-change/ownership-request shapes);
  `HubSummary` now carries `handle` (not `name`); added `CreateExportRequest`
  with `ExportFormat = "markdown" | "pdf" | "docx"`.
- De-normalized links and tags (the "store once, link many" / "shared tag pool"
  normalization stopped paying off in a single-user tool). An external resource
  now stores its own canonical `url` (dedup is a per-collection unique index);
  the `links` table and its module are removed. Tags are a normalized `text[]`
  on the resource and collection, set on create/update — the `tags`,
  `collection_tags`, `resource_tags` tables, the tags module, the tag
  attach/detach endpoints, and orphan-pruning are all removed. Cross-library
  retrieval is deferred to full-text search (Phase E). `@nslinkhub/types`
  updated (resource `url`/`tags`, collection `tags`, `CollectionShareView`
  uses `displayName`).
- Nesting is now a single action on existing collections. Removed `createChild`
  (`POST /collections/:id/children`, create-and-nest) and reparenting via
  `PATCH` (`parentCollectionId` dropped from the update DTO). The one way to
  nest is `POST /collections/:id/collections { collectionId }` — add an existing
  same-hub collection as a section, creating the structural parent link and the
  section entry atomically. Removing the section entry un-nests the collection.
  This eliminates the two-ways-to-nest ambiguity (and the hidden-section bug
  where reparent created a child without an entry). Collections are always
  created top-level.
- Collection-links are now **sections only**, and transfer is **top-level
  only** (resolves review findings #1, #3, #5, #6, #7). Removed the standalone
  "link an arbitrary collection" endpoint (`POST .../resources/collection-link`,
  its DTO, and the shared type): a collection-link exists only as a child
  collection created via `POST /collections/:id/children`, so every
  collection-link is same-hub, access-inherited, and within the two-level cap
  by construction. `POST /collections/:id/transfer` now rejects transferring a
  section — only a top-level collection transfers, moving with its whole
  subtree, so nothing is stranded cross-hub and no inherited access is dropped.
- Collection structure limits. Collection-links must target a collection in the
  same hub (rejecting cross-hub embeds that could re-expose another owner's
  collection). Collections nest at most two levels (a collection and its
  sections): the hierarchy trigger and the create/reparent paths reject
  sub-sections and reject nesting a collection that already has sections. The
  depth-8 hierarchy rule is replaced by this two-level rule.
- Resources simplified to a link, an editable title, and tags. Removed the
  `description` and `note` fields from the resource model, DTOs, `@nslinkhub/types`
  contract, Markdown export, and CSV import — a resource carries no summary;
  clarify a vague link by renaming its title.
- Collections gained an immutable `creatorUserId` (provenance), set at
  creation, distinct from the mutable owner (`hubId`). Groundwork for
  Drive-style collection ownership transfer: on transfer the owner (hub)
  changes but the creator does not. `ON DELETE SET NULL` so a collection
  outlives its creator's account after a transfer.

- Tenancy reshaped to the Google-Drive individual model (before Track W3).
  A hub is now **one personal space per user** (1:1), identified by a mutable,
  unique **handle** (the "hub name") plus a free-form **display name**. Removed
  hub memberships, invitations, and roles (`HubMembersService`,
  `HubInvitationsService`, their controllers/DTOs, and the `HubMembership` /
  `HubInvitation` tables); removed the better-auth `username` plugin and the
  `username`/`displayUsername` fields; removed the global `User.role` and the
  admin bypass (no admin persona). Collection access is now owner → direct
  reader/editor share → active link → published, with no membership branch.
  Ownership is a transferable FK (`hub.ownerUserId`, `collection.hubId`);
  durable links use the immutable `hubId`, so a handle rename never breaks a
  saved reference. The username-based `/users/:username` routes became a
  self-service profile at `/api/v1/profile` (display name, bio, handle). The
  `0_init` migration was reshaped (squash) with all hand-written SQL objects
  preserved. Full write-up: `docs/exec-plans/active/drive-model-tenancy.md`.

- Tags: orphaned tags are now pruned automatically. Because tags are global
  (unique by name, shared across hubs), a tag is deleted only when nothing
  references it anywhere — after detaching it from a collection/resource, or
  after a resource/collection delete cascades its last reference away. Adds a
  `pruneOrphanTags` helper (tags module) wired into the detach and delete
  paths, hardens tag creation to an upsert against races, and an e2e test.
  Removes the "unused tags never removed" tech-debt item.

- Tooling: replaced ESLint + Prettier with Biome (`biome.json`) for
  workspace-wide formatting and linting, run from the repository root and
  wired into `bun run verify` (`format:check` + `lint`). `useImportType` is
  disabled for `apps/api` only, because NestJS dependency injection and
  `emitDecoratorMetadata` require runtime imports for decorated
  classes/parameters; it stays enabled for `packages/*`, `tooling/`, and the
  future `apps/web`. Added an explicit `apps/api` `tsc --noEmit` typecheck to
  `verify` (also covers test files). Trade-off recorded in the tech-debt
  tracker: Biome has no type-aware lint rules, so `no-floating-promises` and
  `no-unsafe-*` coverage is dropped (type errors still caught by `tsc`).

- Operational-foundations direction: documented transactional email
  (`docs/design-docs/transactional-email.md` — Resend behind an application
  adapter, backend-owned React Email templates, PostgreSQL outbox + BullMQ
  worker, signed webhooks; better-auth mints verification/reset tokens, the
  app only delivers them) and observability
  (`docs/design-docs/observability.md` — Pino JSON logging, Sentry +
  OpenTelemetry/OTLP + Grafana Alloy → Grafana Cloud, PII allowlist). Both are
  direction only; implementation lands at its tracked trigger. Full-text
  search moved from an open product decision to a tracked Phase E item.

- Shared contracts (Track W2): added `packages/types` (`@nslinkhub/types`) —
  a source-only workspace package of hand-curated API request/response wire
  contracts (envelope, collections, resources, hubs, imports, exports;
  timestamps as ISO strings) for the web app and extension to consume, and
  `tooling/check-client-boundaries.ts`, which fails if a client imports
  `apps/api` internals or Prisma. The root `bun run verify` now runs the
  boundary check and the types typecheck alongside the API verify.

- Invitations + membership management (Phase D): hub roles are now enforced
  (owner > admin > member) via `HubsService.requireHubRole`. Hubs gained the
  ways people join and are managed: `POST /hubs/:hubId/invitations`
  (`{email, role}` — inviting a member needs admin+, inviting an admin needs
  owner; random expiring one-time hashed token, email delivery a logged
  no-op), list/revoke invitations, and `POST /invitations/accept` (`{token}`
  in the body; the authenticated acceptor's email must match; creates the
  membership). Membership endpoints: `GET /hubs/:hubId/members`,
  `PATCH /members/:userId` (role change, owner-only), `DELETE /members/:userId`
  (admin removes members, owner removes anyone, self-leave allowed) — all
  under the last-owner rule — and `POST /hubs/:hubId/transfer-ownership`
  (target member → owner, actor → admin, one transaction). This completes the
  backend of the hub architecture; remaining work is the client tracks and
  Phase E hardening.

- Authorization + public surfaces (Phase C): a single
  `CollectionPolicyService` now resolves all collection access (first match:
  published → read, hub membership → full, direct share → reader/editor,
  active link/token → read) and replaces the interim membership checks across
  collections, resources, tags, imports, and exports. Capability tiers land:
  hub members manage (publish, share, delete), direct-share editors write
  content only, readers/link/published read only. New surfaces: `GET /explore`
  (replaces `/collections/public`), public hub pages `GET /hubs/:hubId` and
  `GET /hubs/:hubId/collections`, hub-scoped lookup
  `GET /hubs/:hubId/collections/:slug` (which replaces and deletes the
  mutable-username lookup route), publish/unpublish, `PUT /link-sharing`
  (enable/disable/rotate; disabling clears the token), direct shares CRUD,
  save/unsave, and `GET /me/shared` + `GET /me/saved` (with dormant handling).
  Opening a valid share link records a link-sourced share on the viewer's
  shared/ surface, valid only while link sharing stays enabled. Reads that
  fail access now return 404 (not 403) for resources the caller cannot know
  exist.

- Documented the API/persistence casing convention
  (`docs/design-docs/conventions.md`): camelCase JSON keys, snake-token enum
  values, snake_case DB columns via Prisma `@map`. Fixed the one endpoint
  that broke it — the import response now returns camelCase counts
  (`totalRows`, `importedCount`, `errorCount`, …) instead of snake_case, and
  gained its first e2e coverage.

- Hub tenancy (Phase B): the domain model became **Hub → Collections →
  Resources**. Hubs are the tenant root and own collections through a
  `hub_id` foreign key; users belong to hubs via `hub_memberships`
  (`owner | admin | member`) and every sign-up atomically creates a personal
  hub (owner membership) through an app-owned, auth-path-agnostic onboarding
  hook. The visibility triad was replaced by a `published` boolean plus
  `link_sharing_enabled` (rotatable share token); `collection_shares`,
  `collection_saves`, and `hub_invitations` tables were added (schema now;
  endpoints in Phases C/D). The `0_init` migration was reshaped (nothing is
  deployed) and the `repositories`/`entries` modules, routes, and vocabulary
  were renamed to `collections`/`resources` — API routes move to
  `/api/v1/collections/:id/resources|tags|children|export` and
  `/api/v1/users/:username/collections/:slug`. Interim access is
  hub-membership based; Phase C installs the full policy service. Fixed a
  latent bug found in passing: the browser-friendly `?s=<token>` share-link
  query was rejected by the global `forbidNonWhitelisted` pipe.

- Foundation conventions (Phase A): failures now return the stable error
  envelope `{ error: { code, message, requestId, details } }` with stable
  machine-readable codes; every response carries a server-generated
  `X-Request-Id`; startup fails fast on malformed configuration; and the
  entries and public-repositories listings switched from page/limit to
  opaque cursor pagination (`meta: { limit, nextCursor }`, `total` dropped).

- Restructured the repository into a Bun workspace (Track W1): the backend
  moved to `apps/api` (`@nslinkhub/api`) with history-preserving renames,
  shared TypeScript base config landed in `packages/config`, and root
  scripts delegate (`bun run verify` et al. keep working from the root).
  The move surfaced and fixed two undeclared direct dependencies (`dotenv`,
  `express`) and dropped library-style declaration emit from the app build.

- Retired the v2 feature spec. It described the pre-hub direction (user
  ownership, visibility triad, JWT auth) and is superseded by PRODUCT.md and
  the hub design; only currently-true behavior was carried over
  (canonical-URL rules, import partial-failure reporting) plus two real gaps
  into the tech-debt tracker (unused-tag cleanup, export retention). Its
  spec-era API contracts (ETag/Last-Modified caching, folder-tree bookmark
  mapping) were dropped — the hub-era API design decides those fresh.

- Migrated the stack to Bun (runtime + package manager), Prisma 7 (driver
  adapter, generated client, single `0_init` migration owning triggers and
  CHECK constraints), and self-hosted better-auth (bearer + username plugins,
  argon2id via `Bun.password`), replacing npm/Node, TypeORM, and JWT/Passport.
- Restarted API versioning at `/api/v1` (the Flask-era v1 never shipped).
- Renamed `docker-compose.yml` to `compose.yml` (local development only);
  production topology will live in swarm-dialect `docker.stack.<env>.yml`
  files.
- Adopted the pigfarm workflow wholesale: `AGENTS.md` map + `CLAUDE.md`,
  `PRODUCT.md` as the canonical product definition, ExecPlans under
  `docs/exec-plans/` (`PLANS.md` format, tech-debt tracker), focused
  principles docs (`docs/CORE_BELIEFS.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`,
  `docs/RELIABILITY.md`), design documents under `docs/design-docs/` with an
  index, runbooks under `docs/runbooks/` (local development, verification,
  migrations, reference context), a root `bun run verify` gate, a rewritten
  concise `ARCHITECTURE.md` map, git-ignored `ref/` scratch area, and this
  changelog. The pre-ExecPlan session workflow (TASKS.md, `.codex/`,
  developer-workflow/dev-session/implementation-status/PROJECT_STATE docs)
  was removed.

### Fixed

- DB-generated ids are returned on insert (entry/tag/export-job creation no
  longer fails on new rows) — fixed wholesale by the Prisma migration.
- `PATCH .../entries/reorder` was unreachable (shadowed by the `:entryId`
  route); reorder is now declared before parameter routes.
- `GET /repositories/:id/entries` and `GET /repositories/:id/children` were
  unreachable (shadowed by the `:owner/:slug` catch-all); the owner/slug
  lookup moved to `GET /users/:username/repositories/:slug` with e2e
  regression tests, including a non-uuid 400 canary.

### Added

- Local dev services via `compose.yml` (PostgreSQL 18, Redis 7).
- E2E regression suite running the production HTTP stack (better-auth mount +
  body-parser ordering) through shared `configureApp`.
- Authoritative forward design: hub architecture plan (hubs → collections →
  resources, Drive-style sharing, explore/saves, workspace + clients) and the
  ns-series identity and deployment directions.
